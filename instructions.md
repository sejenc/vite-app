# Requirements

We'll review your work in this private repo. If you run into issues, please reach out to us and let us know. We like to review each commit to see how you build out your code bit by bit, and refactor as necessary.

Review form-design.png and the provided acceptance criteria in the README. We’ll be assessing these assignments against whether the acceptance criteria are met as well as how closely your project resembles the provided design.

Build the design with HTML, CSS/SASS, and Javascript.​ You are welcome to use any additional tools you might normally use in your workflow (i.e., pre/post-processors), and you are welcome to use any Javascript frameworks on your task. However, please note that our team uses Vue, so if you’d like to make a special impression on us, we’d love to see how you build this interface with <https://vuejs.org/>

Be prepared to discuss your code. ​Treat this project as though it were part of a larger codebase and design system (i.e., scalability, flexibility and semantics matter). Be prepared to talk through your decisions upon completion of this prototype.

## Final Notes

You are free to read and search for any materials needed to complete the test. However, under no circumstances should another person help you write your code.

If your code requires compilation, please provide instructions on how to build your project.

If you do decide to use a framework like React or Vue, keep in mind that creating a project from the ground up offers some additional complexities. There are tools such as <https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html#vue-create> and <https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html> but it’s also completely viable to do this project using “pure” Javascript.

Bonus Points:

See an opportunity for cool interaction design elements? Go for it! Want to make your interface more accessible for screen readers? We’d love to see that!

Deploy your prototype somewhere public (i.e., Amazon S3, Heroku, GitHub pages, etc.) and include the URL when submitting the assignment back to us.

## Due Date

Please finish commits and work on this assignment by Wednesday, June 23rd, at 11:59pm. Thanks and good luck!
